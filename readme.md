#TODO description of what the site is. I wouldn't do this till we're close to completion personally cause we all know what we're doing.

I would say we use it to log changes for now but that's what git commits are for.

The repo is set up so changes only go through after my review. I don't think y'all can change the master branch so don't try. Make a branch for your changes and then a pull request, after which I'll make sure nothing breaks. IIRC y'all can all mess with eachothers branches though so collaboration on a branch is possible and likely often necessary. I recommend the LiveShare extension which lets y'all edit code in a call simultaneously like a google docs and zoom hybrid.
