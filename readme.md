Team Wok Like a Duk has created an intuitive, accessible, and completely online tool which allows anyone to become a fantastic home chef. There are many great cooking resources out there with recipes made by prominent chefs, television personalities, and many more, but it can be tiresome to search through these to find what you are looking for. Wok Like a Dukâ€™s website performs the search and streamlines the results to the user in an easy to use manner, as well as automatically generating a shopping list for the associated recipe and allowing the user to save their favorite recipes on a free-to-make account. The website was designed with the intention of becoming a one-stop resource for those cooking at home, with efficiency and ease of use at the forefront of the design philosophy in every feature.
